# QA cinemas test
some work for QA consulting on a cinema based project using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Essentially trying to create a form of payment system in which ticket prices can be added together, printing a result. This task got more complicated when adding a Wednesday discount variable, meaning customers were charged Â£2 less on Wednesdays only.

Although the task was taken on with no knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS, I really found it enjoyable and exploring the new languages and how they interacted was a fun exercise.
